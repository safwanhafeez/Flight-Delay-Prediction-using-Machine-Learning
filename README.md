# Flight Delay Prediction ML Project

A comprehensive machine learning project focused on predicting flight departure delays using multiple modeling approaches. This project integrates weather data with flight information to analyze delay patterns and build predictive models that can help improve aviation industry operations.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Flight departure delays are a critical challenge in the aviation industry, affecting passenger satisfaction, airline operations, and overall efficiency. This project aims to predict departure delays using historical flight data combined with weather information to identify key factors contributing to delays.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses three main datasets:
- **Training Data**: Historical flight information with actual departure times
- **Test Data**: Flight data for prediction (without actual departure times)
- **Weather Data**: Meteorological information to be integrated with flight data

## 🚀 Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- **Data Integration**: Merge weather dataset with flight data
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and format time fields
- **Feature Engineering**: 
 - Calculate departure delays
 - Extract temporal features (day of week, hour, month)
 - Integrate relevant weather features

### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Visualizations**: Delay distributions and temporal analysis
- **Correlation Analysis**: Relationship between weather and flight delays
- **Category-wise Analysis**: Delays by airline, airport, and flight status
- **Data Consistency**: Compare training and testing datasets

### Phase 3: Predictive Modeling

#### Binary Classification
- Classify flights as "on-time" (delay = 0) or "delayed" (delay > 0)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

#### Multi-Class Classification
- Categorize flights into delay ranges:
 - No Delay (0 min)
 - Short Delay (<45 min)
 - Moderate Delay (45–175 min)
 - Long Delay (>175 min)

#### Regression Analysis
- Predict exact delay duration in minutes
- Evaluation metrics: MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

### Phase 4: Model Optimization
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search and random search optimization
- **Cross-Validation**: K-fold validation for robust performance assessment
- **Model Comparison**: Comprehensive evaluation of different approaches

### Phase 5: Model Testing and Submission
- Generate predictions on test dataset
- Format results for Kaggle competition submission
- Three separate competitions: Regression, Binary Classification, Multi-Classification
